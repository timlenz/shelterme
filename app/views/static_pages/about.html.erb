              <p>Steven is an award-winning filmmaker and the producer and director of the PBS series <span style="font-weight:bold;">SHELTER ME</span>, which celebrates shelter pets with positive and uplifting stories. He is the creator and co-founder of the ShelterMe.com social network, which allows anyone to create an online profile of a shelter pet and search for their new best friend. In addition, Steven produced and directed a film for NOVA/PBS about solar energy titled, <span style="font-weight:bold;">SAVED BY THE SUN</span>. He produced and directed the feature documentary about the TED Conference, <span style="font-weight:bold;">THE FUTURE WE WILL CREATE</span>, with partner Daphne Zuniga. He also created and directed the PBS series, <span style="font-weight:bold;">THE LIVING CENTURY</span>, which told the amazing stories of the 20th Century through individuals who were at least 100 years old. He produced this project with Barbra Streisand. Steven was a marketing and studio executive prior to launching his production company.</p>
              <p>Steven is an animal lover and proud to share his life with three shelter dogs:  Reba, Blue and Emma. They make him laugh and smile every day. The journey these dogs took to become part of his life was the inspiration for creating the project <span style="font-weight:bold;">SHELTER ME</span>. He has made a life-long commitment to help shelter pets find great, loving homes. In speaking about his dogs, Steven says:</p>
              <p>&quot;Reba was my first shelter dog.  She found her way into my heart in 2007.  The first day I met her, she was so shy.  She got really low to the ground and crawled over to me.  I have a soft spot for shy dogs.  I knew that with some structure and love, she would blossom.  And she did : )  The first day at home she was cautious.  But I was very patient with her.  We went on daily walks and you could see her confidence growing every day.  Then she found the bed.  Oh, does she love sleeping at the foot of my bed.  Our bond grows stronger every day.  Reba is a different dog than when we first met.  She loves to run and play and meet new people. She got a second chance and that has made my life a lot brighter.</p>
              <p>&quot;I was driving home from the farmer's market and saw a dog on the side of the road. He looked out of place. He was very skinny, had no collar and wasn't neutered. It looked like he didn't know where to go. I pulled over. I had some treats and a leash in my car. He wouldn't let me get closer than 10 feet, but welcomed any treats that I threw to him. I told him I wanted to help him. The closer I tried to get the more he moved away. And so began my three hour odyssey to catch him. I called animal control and a group of us finally caught him and brought him to the shelter. I visited him every day. I named him Blue. As expected, no one came to claim Blue and the day he was put up for adoption, I paid the fee, got him fixed and promised to find him a great home. I don't think he had ever been in a house before or walked on a leash. He certainly learned quickly. He was so sweet and loving and got along great with my other dog, Reba. I soon realized that I was going to give Blue that great home I promised him and he was going to be my friend for the rest of his life.&quot;</p>

              <p>Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Actually, that's still true. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</p>
