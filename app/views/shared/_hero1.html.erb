    <p>Every year, 3 - 4 million dogs and cats are euthanized in America's shelters. Most people have never been to a pet shelter and may not even know where their local shelter is. Even if you're not looking to adopt, shelters need your support. Our goal is to bring more people into the shelters to give these pets a second chance.</p>
